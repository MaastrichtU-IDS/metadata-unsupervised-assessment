growth condition and treatment,treatment,"radish sprout seeds were sterilized (5 min 70% ethanol, 10 min 1% naocl with 0.1% tween), then washed five times with sterile water and subsequently incubated in sterile ms medium without glucose in sterile plastic boxes (1 l total volume, passively aerated). after germination, seedlings were tested for sterility by plating a sample on lb agar. after 5 days of growth, the shoots were inoculated 10 min with 1 l __ concentrated ringer solution containing 103 cfu/ml ehec. the superfluous medium was decanted and cfu/g was periodically determined as followsinfected shoots were washed and bacterial numbers of the washing liquid were determined by serial dilution platings. after 120 hours, the transition from exponential to stationary phase could be determined. bacteria were harvested by gently shaking the seedlings in cold __-concentrated ringer (+1% tween-20
 tenfold diluted lysogeny broth was used as reference medium. cells were harvested after 3.5 h at about 3.1 x 108 cfu/ml.
 for nitrite, we added 200 mg/l sodium nitrite to 10-fold diluted lb and adjusted it to ph 6. harvest was after 6.5 h at 2.9 x 108 cfu/ml.
 for spinach medium, whole spinach leaves were homogenized (agienda agricola pistelle, kaufland, germany) on ice using an ultraturrax d50. the mush was centrifuged (1 h, 30,000_g, 5_c), decanted, filtered (2.5 _µm pore size), centrifuged (2 h, 30,000_g, 5_c), decanted and sterile filtered (0.2 _µm). after 5 h of growth, we harvested the cells at 6.0 x 108 cfu/ml."
